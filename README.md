# Rust Fundamentals Training

## Preqrequisites

Before the workshop, make sure you have the correct tools installed and verified. You need:

1. [Rustup Toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
2. An editor of your choice (we highly recommmend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + Extensions)

## Install and verify Rust

[Rustup](https://rustup.rs) provides you with all the software to compile and run Rust applications, e.g.

1. Cargo - build tool and package manager
2. `rustfmt` - Auto-formatting tool for Rust code
3. `clippy` - Linting for common mistakes

[and many more](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/). *Rustup* also allows you to install different compile targets and multiple toolchains, as well as keeping your toolchains up to date.

After installing, you should have a set of new command line tools available. 

Verify your *Rust* installation:

1. Open a Terminal/Shell of your choice
2. Navigate to a folder you want to use for your Rust projects
3. Enter

    ```bash
    $ cargo new installation-test
    ```

4. Cargo will create a "Hello World" application for you. Enter the newly created directory

    ```bash
    $ cd installation-test
    ```

5. Build and run

    ```bash
    $ cargo run
    ```

If you see compile information and `Hello, world!` printed out on your command line, you are ready to go!

If you want to try the samples using Rust with client-side Wasm, please also install [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).

## Tooling with VSCode

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for your platform.

We recommend to use the following extensions and tools:

1. [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer)
2. [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) for debugging
3. [Dependi](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fill-labs.dependi)
4. [Just Command Runner](https://github.com/casey/just) including [Just support in VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=skellock.just)
5. [watchexec](https://watchexec.github.io/)
6. Optional ones depending on your preferences:
   1. [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)
   2. [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
   3. [dotenv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv)
   4. [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
