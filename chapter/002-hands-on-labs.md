## Goal

> Practice Rust concepts covered in the training in a larger end-to-end sample

- Library with data structures and logic
- Command-line app (CLI)
- Web API with JS frontend
- Rust in the browser via WASM

---

## Topic

- Build various flavors of the classical [Battleship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))
- Simplified game logic: Single human player plays against the computer
  - Computer places ships randomly
  - Goal: Sink ships with as few shots as possible

---

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the extensions
  - Extensions: *rust-analyzer* and *CodeLLDB*
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for web UI)

## Exercise Mode

- Focus <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> on concepts
  - Trainer will show samples and walk you through the code
  - Try to understand concepts, ask questions
- Limited <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> hands-on experience
  - Start with empty folder, build sample by copying code from GitHub step-by-step
  - Follow along with trainer, try to understand code and concepts
- Existing <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Rust knowledge
  - Copy just unit tests
  - Try to implement solution on your own
