## Discussion: Why are you curious?

- What do you expect from Rust and this workshop?
  - Prior knowledge?
- What is appealing to you?
- What do you expect to be different from other languages you use?
- How would you convince someone who has never heard about Rust to look into it?

## Why Rust in Linux?

- No undefined behavior [...], including **memory safety** and the **absence of data races**.
- **Stricter type system** for further reduction of logic errors.
- A clear distinction between **safe and `unsafe`** code.
- **Featureful** language [...]
- Extensive freestanding **standard library** [...]
- Integrated out of the box **tooling** [...]

Overall, Rust is a language that has successfully leveraged decades of experience from system programming languages as well as functional ones [...] [(source)](https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1023)

> Rust is an intriguing language. It closely resembles C++ in many ways, hitting all the right notes [...]. [...] it also has the potential to solve some of the most vexing issues that plague C++ projects [...].

[Microsoft](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/04/30/rust-winrt-public-preview/)

---

> Rust provides memory safety guarantees [...] and runtime checks to ensure that memory accesses are valid. This safety is achieved while providing equivalent performance to C and C++.

> For developers, Rust offers the performance of older languages like C++ with a heavier focus on code safety. Today, there are hundreds of developers at Facebook writing millions of lines of Rust code.

## Real-world, production-grade projects

- [AWS Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) - Virtualization on AWS Lambda and Fargate
- [Deno](https://deno.land) - A Node.js-like language runtime for JavaScript
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com) - A good deal of the new rendering engine is written in Rust
- Cloudflare - Core Edge Logic
- NPM - Parts of the registry architecture is written in Rust

## What's unique about Rust

- Rust is compiled to machine code (via LLVM) - native speed!
- A minimal runtime
- No gargabe collection, but a unique and effective memory management solution: Ownership
- Guaranteed memory safety
- "Debug at compile time" and "Hack without fear"

## A feature-rich language

- Rust has influences from Alef, C#, C++, Cyclone, Erlang, Haskell, Limbo, Newsqueak, OCaml, Ruby, Scheme, Standard ML, Swift
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Cargo and crates for dependency management
- Same goals as Go, different approach
