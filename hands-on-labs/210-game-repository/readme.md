# Game Repository

## Introduction

Rocket has powerful features built-in for managing state in memory or in databases ([see docs](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/state/)). We want to keep things simple here because we are just learning Rust fundamentals. Therefore, we are going to implement a simple in-memory repository of Battleship games.

## *game_repository.rs*

Add the file *game_repository.rs* to the *battleship_web_api* package. Copy the content from [game_repository.rs](../999-final/battleship_web_api/src/game_repository.rs) or implement it yourself based on the included unit tests. Make yourself familiar with the code and/or discuss it with your Rust trainers. Note the recommended reading links at the beginning of the file.
