# Single-Player Game

## Introduction

In real world, Battleship games are played by two humans. In our example, a single human player plays against the computer. The computer places the ships randomly and the user's goal is to sink all ships with as few shots as possible. In this exercise we are going to implement the game logic for such single-player games.

## *single_player_game.rs*

Add the file *single_player_game.rs* to the *battleship_game_logic* package. Copy the content from [single_player_game.rs](../999-final/battleship_game_logic/src/single_player_game.rs) or implement it yourself based on the included unit tests. Make yourself familiar with the code and/or discuss it with your Rust trainers. Note the recommended reading links at the beginning of the file.

Don't forget to add the new modules to *lib.rs*.

## Verify

* Use `cargo build` to verify that your project compiles.
* Use `cargo clippy` to verfiy that you follow Rust coding guidelines.
* Use `cargo test` to verify that all tests pass.

## Discussion

How would you let a user play a single-player game in our existing Battleship CLI? Think about the solution and try to implement it on your own if you like.
